<h3>About PlotsOfData</h3>
<p>The PlotsOfData Shiny app plots the data and statistics to enable the comparison of (experimental) conditions. The philosophy of the approach is that plotting the raw data (instead of a summary) improves transparency and interpretation (see also <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/leaving-bar-five-steps/">this blog</a>). To further facilitate the comparison, summary statistics (mean, median, boxplot) and inferential statistics (confidence intervals) can be added. The user has full control over the visibility of the raw data and statistics by adjustment of the transparency (alpha).</p>
<p>Bootstrapping is used to calculate the (asymmetric) 95% CI of medians. More information in <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/a-better-bar/education/">this blog</a> </p>

<p>The data can be supplied in spreadsheet/long format (e.g. by copy-pasting from excel) or in tidy format. For more information on the conversion of spreadsheet data to tidy data see <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/converting-excellent-spreadsheets-tidy-data/education/">this blog</a>.</p>


<p>The plot can be saved as a PDF file, which can be opened and edited with Adobe Illustrator to allow for fine adjustments of the lay-out.</p>
